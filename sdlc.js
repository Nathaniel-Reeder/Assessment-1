// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/


// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements ="Performed with input from the client and other stakeholders, determines what will need to be done to produce the software. Often done at the same time as planning."

const design = "This stage focuses on designing the product. It involves product architects and developers who will present a design of the product. They may present more than one design approach."

const Implementation = "This is the stage where coding takes place and software is created."

const testingAndIntegration = "During this stage, pieces of code are tested, put together, and tested to ensure bugs aren't introduced. Software may need further work after this step to be ready to release."

const maintain = "This step is ongoing, and involves continued maintenance of the code during its lifetime. This includes fixing new bugs and potentially providing updates that improve functionality."
